# GAN-DLD
Planning to make a `preprocess.py` in this outer directory and then a folder for each model.
You can use `assignment.py` to run the project. Default arguments are to train the Siamese model on the CEDAR dataset.

You can download the english dataset [here](https://cedar.buffalo.edu/NIJ/data/) and place it in a `/data` directory.

I needed to download an app to extract the files from `.rar` file. I used [The Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12).
